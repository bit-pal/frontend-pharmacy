    { 
      question: "What is premature ejaculation?",
      answer: "Premature ejaculation (PE) is when a man ejaculates (comes) too quickly during sexual intercourse, typically within one minute of penetration. It's one of the most common male sexual problems, affecting up to 1 in 3 men at some point in their lives. PE can be classified as either lifelong (primary) - where it has always been present, or acquired (secondary) - where it develops after a period of normal sexual function. While occasional episodes are normal, if PE happens frequently and causes distress or relationship problems, treatment can help."
    },
    { 
      question: "What causes it?",
      answer: "Premature ejaculation can have both psychological and biological causes. Psychological factors include anxiety, stress, depression, relationship problems, performance anxiety, and early sexual experiences. Biological factors may include abnormal hormone levels, irregular levels of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, inflammation or infection of the prostate or urethra, and genetic traits. In many cases, PE is caused by a combination of physical and psychological factors. It's important to understand that PE is a medical condition, not a reflection of masculinity or sexual competence."
    },
    { 
      question: "Can treatment work?",
      answer: "Yes, premature ejaculation is very treatable. Medications like Priligy (dapoxetine) have been clinically proven to help delay ejaculation and improve control. Studies show that men using Priligy can increase their time to ejaculation by 3-4 times compared to before treatment. Treatment can also include behavioral techniques, counseling, and topical anesthetics. Many men see significant improvement with medication alone, while others benefit from a combination of approaches. The key is to seek help - PE is a common condition with effective treatment options available."
