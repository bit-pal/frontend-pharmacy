    {
      question: "What is male pattern hair loss?",
      answer: "Male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) is the most common cause of hair loss in men, affecting up to 80% of men by age 80. It's caused by a combination of genetics and hormones, particularly sensitivity to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the treatment work?",
      answer: "Hair loss treatments work by either blocking DHT production (finasteride) or improving blood flow to hair follicles (minoxidil). These mechanisms help prevent further hair loss and can promote regrowth in many cases."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the branded version better than the generic version?",
      answer: "Generic finasteride contains the same active ingredient as Propecia and is equally effective. The main difference is cost - generic versions are significantly cheaper while providing the same therapeutic benefits."
    },
    {
      question: "Side effects",
      answer: "Most men tolerate hair loss treatments well. Potential side effects of finasteride may include decreased libido or erectile dysfunction in a small percentage of users. Minoxidil may cause scalp irritation or unwanted hair growth in other areas."

        faqs: [
          { 
            question: "What does Finasteride do?",
            answer: "Finasteride works by blocking the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is the hormone responsible for shrinking hair follicles in men with male pattern baldness. By reducing DHT levels by up to 70%, finasteride helps prevent further hair loss and can promote hair regrowth. It's clinically proven to be effective in treating male pattern hair loss."
          },
          { 
            question: "How long for Finasteride to work?",
            answer: "Most men start to see results from finasteride within 3 to 6 months of daily use. However, it can take up to 12 months to see the full benefits. It's important to continue taking finasteride as directed, as results are gradual. Some men may notice that hair loss has slowed down before they see visible regrowth. Maximum results typically occur after 1-2 years of consistent use."
          },
          { 
            question: "Does Finasteride regrow hair?",
            answer: "Yes, finasteride can promote hair regrowth in many men. Clinical studies show that about 65% of men experience hair regrowth after taking finasteride for 2 years. However, results vary from person to person. Some men see significant regrowth, while others primarily experience a slowing or stopping of hair loss. Finasteride is most effective at preventing further hair loss and works best when started early in the hair loss process."
          },
          { 
            question: "Does Finasteride slow hair loss?",
            answer: "Yes, finasteride is highly effective at slowing and stopping hair loss. Clinical studies show that finasteride can halt male pattern baldness in 83% of men. By reducing DHT levels, it helps prevent further miniaturization of hair follicles. Most men who take finasteride will maintain their existing hair and prevent further loss. It's important to continue taking the medication to maintain these benefits, as stopping finasteride will result in hair loss resuming."
          },
          { 
            question: "Does Finasteride work on your hairline?",
            answer: "Yes, finasteride can be effective on the hairline, but results vary. It tends to work best on the crown (top of the head) and mid-scalp areas. Some men do experience hairline regrowth or stabilization, particularly if treatment is started early. However, the hairline can be more resistant to treatment compared to other areas. Finasteride is most effective when started before significant hairline recession has occurred. Consistent use over 12-24 months provides the best chance of seeing hairline improvements."

        faqs: [
          { 
            question: "What does Minoxidil do?",
            answer: "Minoxidil is a topical treatment that stimulates hair growth by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels. This improves blood flow to hair follicles, delivering more oxygen and nutrients to support hair growth. It also prolongs the growth phase (anagen phase) of the hair cycle and can revive hair follicles that have shrunk due to DHT. Minoxidil is FDA-approved for treating hair loss and has been clinically proven to promote hair regrowth in 70% of men."
          },
          { 
            question: "How long for Minoxidil to work?",
            answer: "You can expect to see initial results from minoxidil within 2 to 4 months of consistent twice-daily use. However, it typically takes 6-12 months to see significant hair regrowth. During the first few weeks, you may experience increased shedding - this is normal and temporary as weak hairs are replaced by stronger ones. For best results, continue using minoxidil for at least 4 months before evaluating its effectiveness. Patience and consistent application are key to success."
          },
          { 
            question: "Does Minoxidil regrow hair?",
            answer: "Yes, minoxidil can promote hair regrowth. Clinical studies show that approximately 70% of men experience hair regrowth with consistent use of minoxidil. Results vary depending on the extent of hair loss, age, and how long you've been losing hair. Minoxidil works best when started early in the hair loss process and is most effective on the crown area. While some men experience significant regrowth, others may see moderate improvement or mainly a slowing of hair loss. When combined with finasteride, success rates can increase to 94%."
          },
          { 
            question: "Does Minoxidil slow hair loss?",
            answer: "Yes, minoxidil is effective at slowing down hair loss. Even if significant regrowth doesn't occur, minoxidil helps maintain existing hair and slows the progression of hair loss. It works by prolonging the growth phase of hair follicles and improving blood circulation to the scalp. Regular use can help prevent further thinning and keep hair follicles healthier. For many users, preventing additional hair loss is just as valuable as promoting regrowth. Continued use is necessary to maintain these benefits."
          },
          { 
            question: "How to apply Minoxidil?",
            answer: "Apply minoxidil twice daily - once in the morning and once in the evening - to clean, dry scalp. For foam: Dispense half a capful onto your fingers and gently massage into thinning areas. For spray: Apply 6-8 sprays directly to affected areas. Make sure your scalp is completely dry before application. Avoid washing your hair for at least 4 hours after applying. Wash your hands thoroughly after use. Don't use more than the recommended dose, as this won't improve results. Consistency is crucial - missing applications reduces effectiveness."
